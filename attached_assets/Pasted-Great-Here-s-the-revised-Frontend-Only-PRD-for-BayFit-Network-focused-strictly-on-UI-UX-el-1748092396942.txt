Great! Here's the revised **Frontend-Only PRD** for **BayFit Network**, focused strictly on UI/UX elements and frontend implementation. All backend, AI/ML, and integration points are deferred or stubbed for future development. This version assumes **no backend logic**—purely static or frontend-interactive (with mock data or placeholders).
